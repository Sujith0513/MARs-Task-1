**Reflection :-**

1) I have learnt many new functions and some languages
1) At first I learnt bash code in shell scripting whose syntax were very hard to learn but it was very useful for many things.
1) Then I learnt about how to create, move, copy, rename directories and files.
1) Then I learnt C++ language which was similar to c but it was in a high level language when compared to C.
1) Using that I did the medium dose where we had to create a custom data type.
1) Then for the high dose I have used python for the 1<sup>st</sup> program. The question was pretty impressive and interesting.
1) Then for the high dose 2<sup>nd</sup> question I used cv2 module in python. cv2 was easy then I thought and was very easy to understand.
